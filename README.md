# OpenAI Logs Exporter 📊

A Chrome extension that exports OpenAI platform logs to CSV format. Automatically collects and deduplicates logs as you browse, making it easy to download your conversation history for analysis or backup.

## ✨ What Does This Do?

This extension adds an "Export to CSV" button to your OpenAI logs page. When you click it, all your conversation logs are downloaded as a CSV file that you can open in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet program.

**Features:**

- ✅ Automatically collects logs as you scroll through the page
- ✅ Keeps track of all logs you've seen (no duplicates!)
- ✅ Shows you how many logs have been collected
- ✅ Downloads everything to a CSV file with one click
- ✅ 100% private - nothing is sent to any servers

> **⚠️ Important:** If you switch to a different project/group in OpenAI, **refresh the page** (F5 or Cmd+R) to reset the log counter. This ensures you're only exporting logs from the current project.

### Step 3: Export to CSV

3. The file will be named something like: `openai-logs-2026-01-07.csv`

### Step 4: Open Your File

1. Go to your Downloads folder
2. Open the CSV file in:
   - **Excel** (Windows/Mac)
   - **Google Sheets** (Upload the file)
   - **Numbers** (Mac)
   - Or any spreadsheet program

## 📋 What's in the CSV File?

The CSV file contains 5 columns:

| Column Name    | Description                     | Example                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Request ID** | Unique ID for each conversation | `resp_06e17eee3cb8...`      |
| **Input**      | What you asked the AI           | `"What is photosynthesis?"` |
| **Output**     | What the AI responded           | `"Photosynthesis is..."`    |
| **Model**      | Which AI model was used         | `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`        |
| **Created**    | When the conversation happened  | `Jan 6, 3:27 PM`            |

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### The export button doesn't appear

- Make sure you're on the correct page: `https://platform.openai.com/logs`
- Try refreshing the page (press F5 or Cmd+R)
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### The button says "0 logs"

- Wait a few seconds for logs to load on the page
- Try scrolling down to see more logs
- Make sure you have logs in your OpenAI account

### The CSV file looks weird when I open it

- Make sure you're opening it with a spreadsheet program (Excel, Google Sheets)
- If using Google Sheets: Go to File → Import → Upload the CSV file

### I want to export ALL my logs (more than what's showing)

- Scroll down slowly to load more logs
- Wait for the counter to stop increasing
- The extension captures all logs as they appear on screen
